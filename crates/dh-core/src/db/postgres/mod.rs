//! PostgreSQL adapter (Phase 2 of `plan.md`): connects over TCP, serves the
//! same [`DbAdapter`] surface as SQLite, and translates the engine-agnostic
//! operation types into Postgres dialect (`$n` placeholders, `information_schema`
//! introspection). Storage-only concepts (WAL, byte export) fall back to the
//! trait's unsupported defaults.
