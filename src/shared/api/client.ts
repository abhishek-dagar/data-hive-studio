// Thin re-export barrel. `client.ts` used to be one 1090-line file; it's now
// split by domain (dispatch primitives, connection lifecycle + DDL, query
// execution, streaming) but kept as the single import path since
// most of the app already imports from here (directly or via the
// `shared/api` barrel) and there's no reason to force a mass path rewrite.
